                <p class="intro">I'm an aspiring software developer and writer with too many interests to spell out. I was born in Seoul, South Korea, and have lived in multiple countries ever since. Most of my elementary school years were spent in Vancouver, Canada, but upon starting 5th grade my family immigrated to the United States. After living in North Jersey for the rest of my adolescent years, I went to Villanova University in Pennsylvania, where I earned a degree in Biology and Psychology. While I decided to not pursue a career in either of those fields, I still hold strong interests in both.</p>
                <p class="intro2">I chose to make my transition into software development when I decided that I did not want to pursue academic research in biology or psychology. Immersing myself in programming has convinced me that I made the right choice; I find myself losing track of time when I'm trying to solve a problem in my code.</p>
                <p class="intro3">Apart from those academic interests, I like to follow tech news for entertainment. I am a habitual reader, gamer, and writer; I'm trying to watch more movies. Some of the things I thoroughly enjoyed from last year, and wholeheartedly recommend, include the Mistborn Series by Brandon Sanderson and Disco Elysium.</p>
